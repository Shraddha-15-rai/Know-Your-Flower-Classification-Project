# ðŸŒ¸ Know Your Flower â€“ Flower Classification using CNN

Know Your Flower is a deep learning-based flower classification web application built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Gradio. It classifies images of flowers into five categories: **Daisy**, **Dandelion**, **Rose**, **Sunflower**, and **Tulip**. The model is deployed using Gradio to allow real-time image input and prediction through an intuitive interface.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Trained using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- Achieves **95% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- Supports five distinct flower categories.
- Lightweight and optimized model for fast inference.
- Web-based interface using **Gradio**.
- Easily extendable for more flower types.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** â€“ Model development and training
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** â€“ Data handling and visualization
- **Gradio** â€“ Web interface for real-time testing
- **Google Colab** â€“ Model training environment

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The model uses the [Flowers Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition), which contains over 4,000 labeled flower images.

### Classes:
- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
